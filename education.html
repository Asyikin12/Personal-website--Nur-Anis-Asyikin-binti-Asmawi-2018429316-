<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">My education life start from I am 7 years old. At that time we live in Johor and my first primary school is Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampong Pasir (SKKP) and 
Sekolah Agama Dato Omar Yusof Johor Bahru, Johor. For myself, I live in Johor for nine (9) years which is until I am 9 years old. What I have stated, 2010 we go to Selangor 
and live there. From that, my second primary school is Sekolah Kebangsaan Meru (SK Meru) Jalan Tap, Kapar and Sekolah Rendah Agama Meru II, Meru Klang Selangor. 
This site is not a diary but I want to say that I dont like to stay in Selangor for the first time. It is because I loved to stay in Johor, my hometown and I really 
missed the environment and memories there. Now, its already 10 years and I am already 20 years old but i am still missed Johor Bahru.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">In Sk Meru, I go to the same school with my brother. He is 11 years old and I am 10 years old. In my family, only us that are schooling there. It is something 
that i will never forget  which is the memories schooling together with my brother.After we finished the primary school, we separated which is my brother and I go to different school. 
I've choose to go to the same school with my older sister. It is Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Perempuan Kapar (SMK(P)K). From the school name we know that it is a school that only for 
female students. I've study there from I am 13 years old until 17. Along the years,my school life cycle at that time is only school-go back home-school. I have lack communication with male 
people except my family members and teachers.</p>

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">This story is not end here. After I have finish my school life, I've continue study in local university in Malaysia which named 
University of Technology Mara Kedah Branch. For the first time study at the university is not easy. It is normal for fresh student that still not adapt with university environment. For me, I am willing to study 
here eventhough it will make me stay far from my family. It is one of my dream actually. My course field at the university is Library Management (IM120) under the Faculty of Information Management.

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">I got new friends and experience that not every people get. The "Library Management" course field is not as easy as what people expect. 
It is normal when before we start to study this course we thing this course is simple. Like people said, just learn "how to arrange books on the bookshelf". But, after we go through of the subjects, it is not simple as people 
say. I know every course field have their own difficulties same goes to library management. People never understand if they did not in the same shoes with that person. Thats the reality of life. However, I am very thankful 
to God for giving us (my friends and I) a chance to continue our study and gain new knowledges and experience and we almost finished our diploma in the middle of this year (2020).</p>
