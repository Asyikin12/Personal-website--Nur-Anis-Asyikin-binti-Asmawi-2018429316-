<h1><center><font face="MV Boli" size="6" font color="#D1F2EB">Experience is something that we have faced which can give us lesson to become better in the future</font></center></h1>

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">I start to understand and get more experience is when I was continuing my study at university. That time also where I realize that we need to gain experience more and more in our life for the future.
Appreciate the experience whether it is bitter or sweet, the most important is can give us benefit and value that not everybody get it. Experience is like opportunity that we must grap and never let it
go and just "follow the flow".</p>

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">When we talk about gain experience, i think we need to be brave and have spirit to learn something new in our life. I am a person who contain with full of ashame feelings, and I know that feelings is 
not a mistake to have it but sometimes we need to be brave and get rid of the bad feelings that can make ourself cannot success or failed. As a students, doing presentation infront of the class is normal but for me that things are very challenging to faced. In semester 1 until 
4 we will always do presentation for every subject that we studied so for the beginning, month by month I still cannot adapt the system until the third semester of my diploma I have find the brave.</p>

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">These when in the third semester we also need to do an interview at a library for our assigment, so during the interview we got many knowledge and advices from the librarian that we interview. Her advices 
are about what we need to do to get a good job and what we need to do when we get the job. From that i try to be brave to communicate with other people around me. I am still in learning process and need support.</p>

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">Based on the picture above, my new experience start when my friends and I decided to joined Innovation And Design In Library And Information Science Competition 2018 (Indelib) 2018. 
In this competition I have joined with my friends which is each group maximum four person. This is the first time I make myself joining a big competition. Ofcourse we need to communicate with many people that we did not know before and that is my main challenge
I need to go through. Only my teammates that know how are my situation at that time. We have make invention that named Lovely Finder which is a robotic bookshelf for disabilities people that provide in library. Moreover we 
get bronze in the competition.</p>

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">That is my experience in 2018. For 2019, my friends and I have joined a competition that same purpose with Indelib 2018 but this time it is involve international people. The competition 
named International Students Affairs Invention, Innovation & Design competition  (I-SAIID). This competition we also make an invention related with water bottle. It is water bottle that can be compress and package with metal straw. These two programmes was organised at our 
place, it is UiTM Kedah. Not only that, I am also have joined Youread competition. This competition are intended to encourage users to make reading as their habit.</p>

<p align="center"><font face="calibri (body)"><font size="5"><font color="black">I am a person who like to try new things. Since I am study at this university, I realize that we can try to do whatever we want but make sure it is not a bad thing. Here I also get the 
chance to achieve my dreams. I got to make myself become one of the members of Persatuan Seni Silat Cekak Malaysia (PSSCM) that have in this university. From that, I got more contacts and friends and we have a good relationship with each other. We are just like a family.
From this association also I have learn how to organised a programme whether it is small or big scale programme within do a proposal, and so on. Silat Cekak has teach me many things with giving me knowledges.</p>
